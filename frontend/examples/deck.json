      "question": "In comparing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microservices (MS), which statement accurately describes their core tenets regarding resource sharing according to the document?",
      "answers": [
        "Both SOA and MS aim to share as much as possible to foster reuse.",
        "SOA fosters reuse by sharing as much as possible, while MS shares as little as possible to allow for rapid evolution.",
        "SOA miniaturizes services for rapid evolution, while MS focuses on coarse-grained service composition.",
        "MS emphasizes a rigid, standard-driven specification, whereas SOA is non-prescriptive."

      "question": "When comparing Microservices to Serverless Functions in terms of granularity and lifespan, which distinction is correct?",
      "answers": [
        "Microservices are ultra-fine (function-level) while Serverless Functions are fine-grained (microservice-level).",
        "Microservices are typically ephemeral, whereas Serverless Functions are long-lasting.",
        "Microservices have long-lasting lifespans and independent backends, while Serverless Functions are ephemeral and use external persistence.",
        "Both paradigms utilize a 'bounded context' for state management to ensure independent backend persistence."
