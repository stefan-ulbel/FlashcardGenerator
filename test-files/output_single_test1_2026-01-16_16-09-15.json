{"id":"single-question-1768576178529","topic":"Document-based flashcards","filesUploaded":1,"cards":[{"id":"q-1","question":"What is the primary definition and core administrative purpose of a Learning Management System (LMS)?","answer":"A Learning Management System is a software application designed for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses or training programs."},{"id":"q-2","question":"A student uses a combination of Notion for notes, YouTube for video lectures, and Discord for peer study groups. Why is this considered a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) rather than an institutional LMS?","answer":"It is a PLE because it is a learner-centered collection of tools where the individualÔÇönot an institutionÔÇötakes control of the learning process, goals, and resources, often outside formal institutional systems."},{"id":"q-3","question":"How does the role of the learner differ between a connectivist MOOC (cMOOC) and an extension MOOC (xMOOC)?","answer":"In a cMOOC, learners are active, self-organized participants in a networked learning environment, whereas in an xMOOC, learners typically work independently through provided lecture-like resources and exercises."},{"id":"q-4","question":"In a Flipped Classroom model, how do the 'Before class' and 'During class' phases interact to improve the learning process?","answer":"Learners watch prepared videos at home beforehand to gain foundational knowledge, which allows the 'During class' time to be utilized for discussing open questions and active engagement rather than passive listening."},{"id":"q-5","question":"Why is 'Context-Awareness' a critical mechanism for the function of a Smart Learning Environment (SLE)?","answer":"Context-awareness allows the environment to detect variables like location, time, device, and even emotional state to provide real-time feedback and tailored interventions that optimize the learning experience."},{"id":"q-6","question":"According to David Wiley, what are the '5 R's' that define the permissions granted by Open Educational Resources (OER)?","answer":"The 5 R's are Retain, Re-use, Revise, Remix, and Redistribute."},{"id":"q-7","question":"If an LMS is evolved into a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) as described by Dillenbourg (El09), what specific change occurs regarding the learner's relationship to the digital space?","answer":"The learner becomes an 'actor' who co-constructs the virtual space, turning it from a mere information repository into a social space where interactions turn digital 'spaces' into 'places'."},{"id":"q-8","question":"You wish to translate an OER textbook into another language and share it with a friend. Which of the '5 R's' are you specifically applying, and what is the legal requirement for this modification?","answer":"You are applying 'Revise' (translation) and 'Redistribute' (sharing). Legally, you must address the type of change in the reference and ensure the original license permits such modifications and sharing."},{"id":"q-9","question":"Why is the integration of 'Learning Analytics' considered a major trend for the future of MOOC platforms?","answer":"Learning analytics allow providers to provide adaptive feedback, improve student engagement, and predict drop-out risks by analyzing data-driven patterns in learner behavior and performance."},{"id":"q-10","question":"How does the choice of 'Pedagogy' (e.g., collaborative learning vs. self-paced study) fundamentally shape the design of a 'Virtual Space' in a learning environment?","answer":"The pedagogy dictates the required infrastructure of the virtual space; collaborative pedagogy requires social interaction tools like forums and wikis, while self-paced pedagogy prioritizes modular content navigation and automated assessment tools."}],"createdAt":"2026-01-16T15:09:38.529Z"}
