{"id":"single-question-1768576313814","topic":"Document-based flashcards","filesUploaded":1,"cards":[{"id":"q-1","question":"What is the fundamental definition of a Learning Management System (LMS) according to the text?","answer":"An LMS is a software application designed for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses or training programs."},{"id":"q-2","question":"A university department wants to implement a system that uses sensors to detect a student's emotional state and automatically adjusts task difficulty. Based on the document, which specific variant of a learning environment is required, and why?","answer":"A Smart Learning Environment (SLE). It is the only variant defined as using context-aware and intelligent technologies (like sensors or AI) to detect states and adaptively optimize learning experiences for the individual."},{"id":"q-3","question":"How does the 'Flipped Classroom' model strategically utilize the theoretical foundation of video-based learning to alter the 'During class' phase?","answer":"It uses video-based learning as a 'Before class' tool for content introduction at home, which enables the 'During class' phase to be transformed from a passive lecture into an active session for discussing open questions and practicing skills."},{"id":"q-4","question":"Compare cMOOCs and xMOOCs in terms of their underlying pedagogical philosophy and the learner's role.","answer":"cMOOCs are based on Connectivism, emphasizing participatory, networked learning where students self-organize. xMOOCs are 'Extension' MOOCs that follow a traditional lecture-like structure where learners work individually on provided resources."},{"id":"q-5","question":"An educator wants to create a 'mashup' of various educational videos. If a video is licensed under CC BY-ND (No Derivatives), how does this restriction impact David WileyÔÇÖs '5 RÔÇÖs' of OER?","answer":"The 'No Derivatives' restriction prevents the educator from 'Revise' (modifying the content) and 'Remix' (combining it with other materials to create something new), as the license requires the work to be shared in its original form."},{"id":"q-6","question":"What are the '5 R's' defined by David Wiley regarding the permissions of Open Educational Resources?","answer":"The 5 R's are Retain (control the copy), Re-use (use in various contexts), Revise (adapt/translate), Remix (combine with other materials), and Redistribute (share copies with others)."},{"id":"q-7","question":"Why is the transition of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) from a 'designed information space' to a 'social space' significant for the learner's role?","answer":"It shifts the learner from being a passive consumer of information to an 'actor' who co-constructs the virtual space through educational interactions, turning a digital space into a meaningful 'place' for learning."},{"id":"q-8","question":"A student builds a workflow using Notion for notes, Zotero for references, and Discord for peer communication. Why does this qualify as a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) rather than a Learning Management System (LMS)?","answer":"It is a PLE because it is learner-controlled, tool-agnostic, and distributed across multiple non-institutional platforms, whereas an LMS is instructor-led, structured, and institution-controlled."},{"id":"q-9","question":"In the context of OER creation, how does the principle of 'Openness by Design' influence the selection of technological tools like H5P?","answer":"It encourages the use of tools that allow for easy 'Reuse and modify' (H5P) and 'Openness by Design' ensures the resource is created with a suitable license and modular structure from the start to facilitate the 5 R's."},{"id":"q-10","question":"What is the mechanistic difference between 'Editing' and 'No Editing' when referencing an OER according to the provided guidelines?","answer":"Editing involves actual changes to the substance or form (e.g., changing text content, colors, or language translation), whereas No Editing refers to purely presentation-based additions that don't alter the core asset (e.g., adding a frame, reformatting text, or simple resizing)."}],"createdAt":"2026-01-16T15:11:53.814Z"}
